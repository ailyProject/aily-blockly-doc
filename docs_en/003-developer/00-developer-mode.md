# Developer Mode  
If you are adapting libraries or development boards, it is highly recommended that you enable developer mode.

## Enable Developer Mode
Through `Menu > Settings > Developer Mode`, enable developer mode.
At this time, the `Developer Floating Menu` will appear in the lower left corner of the blockly workspace.

## Developer Features
Currently provided developer features are:  
1. Reload project.  
  After clicking, you can reload the entire project. If the developer has modified the blockly part of the library, clicking can reload the modified library;  
2. Clear cache.  
  After clicking, you can clear the compilation cache. If the developer has modified the library src source code and compiled before, you need to clear the cache to avoid the system using the previous compilation cache; 
3. Open global resource folder
  After clicking, it will open through the system file manager
4. Open build folder

5. Auto save
  Checked by default, when checked, it will save the project before reloading the project.

## Other
Developer features we will also add here in the future.  
The floating menu can be dragged to other positions in the window to avoid blocking user operations.
