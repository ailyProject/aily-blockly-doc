# aily Project
aily Project is a hardware development integrated environment that plans to integrate many AI capabilities to help hardware developers work more efficiently.

## aily blockly  
aily blockly is the first IDE launched by aily Project. In the early stage, it provides AI-assisted programming capabilities for non-professional users. The long-term goal is to break the boundary between professional and non-professional development, and ultimately achieve natural language programming.

### Current Version Highlights  
1. Engineering Project Management  
Uses npm for project management, managing development boards and libraries on a project-by-project basis. Solves many engineering problems with traditional embedded development environments. For example, using Arduino IDE may cause board package, library, and current project mismatches, resulting in compilation failures and runtime errors. In this software, the development board version and library version in each project are independent and do not affect each other.
2. Library Manager  
Although we have prepared many libraries (covering almost all common modules), these libraries are actually generated by AI and we have not verified them in detail. Beta testers are needed to work with us to verify and improve them.
3. Comprehensive and Compact Serial Debugging Tool  
Attempting to create an all-in-one serial tool. Everyone is welcome to test, provide feedback, and propose new ideas.
4. AI Project Generation  
Automatically analyze projects based on user needs, recommend development boards, modules, libraries, generate project architecture diagrams, pin connection diagrams, and create projects for users.
5. AI Code Generation  
Automatically write programs based on user needs.
6. AI Library Conversion  
Native C/C++ libraries can be easily converted into libraries used by this software. Based on large model configuration generation, during development, if you want to use an Arduino library but there is no corresponding blockly library, just provide the Arduino library to AI, which will automatically analyze and generate the corresponding blockly library. With this feature, this software can become the blockly platform with the most libraries.
7. AI Development Board Configuration Generation  
Based on large model configuration generation, when adding development boards, you no longer need to write configurations manually. Just provide the development board documentation (in md format), and AI will automatically analyze and help you generate the development board configuration file. (Only supports development boards based on esp32, avr, renesas, rp2040, stm32, because the compiler and core SDK still need to be prepared by us in advance to the repository)
8. Lightning Compilation Tool (Phase 1 is online, Phase 2 will accelerate further!)  
Edge-cloud collaboration, lightning compilation  
Reduce the original 1-hour compilation work to 1 minute!

## Unofficial Version Notes  
This alpha version tested is only guaranteed to be minimally functional, and many planned highlight features have not yet been designed and developed.
The current version is not recommended for actual work, as many adjustments we make later may cause incompatibilities between versions.

## Planned Features
· AI enhancement (project template generation, block/library generation, automatic debugging)  
· Multi-version development board and library coexistence management  
· Hardware simulation
